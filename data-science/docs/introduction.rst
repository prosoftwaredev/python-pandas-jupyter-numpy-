Introduction
============

Freestyle Analytics of Financial Benchmarking Data.

The purpose of this directory is to prototype analytics prior to developing analytic components of the online portal. This includes:

 * processing raw input (quality controlled CSV documents) into analytic data frames
 * creating desired outputs (tables, plots) using Pandas, Matplotlib and jupyter


The development process should go something like this:

 1. data scientist prototypes desired outputs here
 2. portal developer refactors library code out of prototypes, and builds portal features
 3. as required, data scientist prototypes new analytic features and feeds them back into step 2
